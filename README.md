## Overview

The Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF) model is a state-of-the-art deep learning approach for building recommendation systems. It generalizes the matrix factorization model by replacing the dot product operation with a neural architecture that can learn complex user-item interactions.

## Features

- End-to-end implementation of the NCF model.
- Support for various loss functions and evaluation metrics.
- Easy integration with different datasets.
- Customizable hyperparameters for model tuning.

## Installation

To get started, clone the repository and install the required dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Recommendation-System-Using-Neural-Collaborative-Filtering.git
cd Recommendation-System-Using-Neural-Collaborative-Filtering
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Once the dependencies are installed, you can train the model using your dataset or a sample dataset provided in the repository.

```bash
python train.py --dataset data/sample_data.csv --epochs 10 --batch_size 256
```

For a detailed description of the available command-line arguments, run:

```bash
python train.py --help
```

## Data

The dataset used for training the recommendation system should be in the form of user-item interactions (e.g., ratings or clicks). You can use publicly available datasets like MovieLens, Amazon Product Reviews, etc., or your own custom data.

Example data format:
```
user_id,item_id,rating
1,101,5
2,102,3
...
```

## Model Architecture

The NCF model combines the strengths of both Generalized Matrix Factorization (GMF) and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). The architecture includes:

- **Input Layer**: Separate embeddings for users and items.
- **GMF Layer**: Captures linear user-item interactions.
- **MLP Layer**: Captures non-linear user-item interactions through several dense layers.
- **Output Layer**: Predicts the interaction score between users and items.

The final prediction is a weighted sum of the outputs from the GMF and MLP components.

## Results

After training, the model achieves the following results on the test set:

- **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)**: X.XX
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: X.XX
- **Precision@K**: X.XX
- **Recall@K**: X.XX

## Future Work

Future improvements to the model may include:

- Implementing additional regularization techniques to prevent overfitting.
- Experimenting with different architectures and hyperparameters.
- Adding support for side information like user demographics or item metadata.
- Integrating with a real-time recommendation engine.
